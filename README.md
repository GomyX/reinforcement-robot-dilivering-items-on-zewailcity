# reinforcement-robot-learning-on-zewailcity
this robot uses the Q-learning algorithm to learn its q values and then to use them to pick 8 objects from two places in Zewail City and to deliver them to another specific two places 4 for each one, the robot is required to explore the city (graph with nodes representing places and edges with weights representing distances) and update its Q values about each state it visits whether it serves its goal or not,
then running the robot based on what it has learned
